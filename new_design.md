GymBaazi: App Concept & Design Specification (v2)
This document defines the refined "Buddy" direction for GymBaazi.

1. App Vision & Vibe
Philosophy: "Your Gym Buddy, Not Your Drill Sergeant." Vibe: Subtle, soothing, encouraging. It should feel like a premium, quiet tool that helps you focus, rather than a loud app shouting at you. Key Change: Shift from "Aggressive Sport" to "Focused Flow".

2. Visual Identity
Theme: "Midnight & Mint" (Dark Mode focus).

Backgrounds: Deep Gunmetal / Charcoal (#1C1C1E to #2C2C2E). Not pitch black which is harsh.
Primary Accent: Soft Mint Green (#66D9AB) or Electric Teal (#40E0D0). Used for primary actions and "Success" states.
Secondary Accent: Slate Blue (#708090). Used for "Buddy" elements/neutral info.
Typography:
Primary Font: Outfit (Google Fonts). It has a modern, geometric feel but is wider and friendlier than standard DIN fonts.
Alternative: Nunito (Rounded) if we want maximum friendliness.
Usage: Large, thin headers. Bold, slightly rounded data points.
Shapes: Soft rounded corners (16px-24px).
Style: "Soft Minimal" / "Flat 2.0".
NO Glassmorphism. No blurs or translucent frosts.
Solid Cards: Elements are solid opaque colors (e.g., #2C2C2E) sitting on the darker background.
Depth: Very subtle drop shadows or just color contrast to separate layers.

3. Core Screen Concepts
A. The Dashboard (Home) — "The Handshake"
Goal: A warm welcome.

Layout:
Header: clean top bar. Left: "Welcome, Prarthana". Right: Small Profile Avatar (Circle). No "Home" title.
Hero Stat: Instead of a flaming streak, a "Consistency Ring" (like Apple Fitness but softer). A Mint Green ring that fills up as you maintain your streak. Text inside: "12 Day Streak".
Weekly Bubble Row: A horizontal row of simple circles. Filled = Done. Empty = Waiting.
Main Action: "Ready for Push Day?" card. Solid slate grey background. Minimal text. Large "Start" pill button in Mint.

B. The War Room (Active Workout) — "The Focus Zone"
Goal: Clarity.

Layout:
List: Clean vertical list of cards.
Expanded Card: When a card opens, it pushes others down. Solid background.
Input: Large, distinct number pickers. No tiny scrollers.
Live Activity: Lock screen widget showing "Resting: 00:43" with a shrinking Mint bar.
Interaction: Tapping "Complete" turns the whole set row Green (subtle flash).

C. History & Stats — "The Logbook"
Goal: Reflection.

Components:
Calendar View: A clean monthly grid. Days with workouts have a small Mint dot under the date.
Log List: Below the calendar, a simple list of "Push Day - 45 mins".
Interactive Charts: (Immersive Stats). Tap a muscle group (e.g., "Chest") -> Slide to a dedicated view showing a clean Line Chart of volume over time. No 3D models. Just elegant, tappable data points.
Records: "Personal Best" pills.

D. The Library (Explore) — "The Playbook"
Goal: Discovery.

Layout:
Grid: A neat grid of muscle groups (Pills or square cards). "Chest", "Back", "Legs". Mint accent on selected.
Detail: Tapping an exercise opens a clean sheet.
Video: A large, edge-to-edge video player at the top (looping).
History: Below the video, a mini-chart showing "Last performed: 3 days ago".
Add Button: a floating action button (Mint) to "Add to Today".

4. Prompt for Design Generation (Copy/Paste this)
Design Prompt: "Create a high-fidelity mobile app UI design for 'GymBaazi', a friendly personal workout tracker.

Aesthetic: 'Soft Dark Mode'. Use deep charcoal backgrounds (not pure black). Primary accent is a Soothing Mint Green. Typography should be modern and approachable (like Outfit or Nunito). Style: Flat, solid opaque cards. No glassmorphism, no blur effects. Clean, high whitespace.

Screen 1 (Home): Top left says 'Welcome, [Name]'. Top right has a profile circle. Center stage is a minimal 'Consistency Ring' graphic (Mint color). Below, a horizontal row of weekday bubbles. A 'Start Workout' card at the bottom.

Screen 2 (History): A clean monthly calendar widget at the top with dots for workout days. Below, a list of completed workout cards. One card shows 'Personal Record: Bench Press' highlight.

Screen 3 (Active): A focused view of a 'Bench Press' exercise. Large, easy-to-tap inputs for Weight and Reps. A 'Rest Timer' overlay at the bottom.

Screen 4 (Library): A clean grid of muscle group pills. One is selected, showing a list of exercises. An 'Add' floating action button in Mint.

Vibe: Tech-savvy buddy. Minimalist. Premium but kind."
